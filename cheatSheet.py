# Data type refers to how the computer knows to classify information. To determine data type, ask what category a value belongs to. Here's a list of the data types that you will surely be using in building web applications.
#
# There are several general classifications for data we're interested in. Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of a language. Most languages have these in common. Here are the most common:
#
# Boolean Values - Assesses the truth value of something. It has only two values: True and False
# Numbers - Integers (whole numbers), floating point numbers (commonly known as decimal numbers), and complex numbers.
# Strings - A text literal. Most pages in the web work with strings quite often.
# Composite types are collections composed of the above primitive types.
#
# Tuples - A type of data that is immutable (can't be modified after its creation) and can hold a group of values. Tuples can contain mixed data types.
# Lists - A type of data that is mutable and can hold a group of values. Usually meant to store a collection of related data.
# Dictionaries - A group of key-value pairs. Dictionary elements are indexed by unique keys which are used to access values.
# We will cover these data types more in the following modules.
#
# In Python, (almost) everything is an object. We will touch on this later when we get into Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
#
# Indentation & Line-Endings
# One of the most important aspects of Python is indentation. Python has no brackets, braces, or keywords to indicate the start and end of certain code blocks such as functions, if statements, and loops. The only delimiter is the colon (:) and the indentation of the code itself. You'll see that indenting starts a new code block and un-indenting ends that block. Don't worry if these codes don't make sense right now; we'll go over function and if- statements later. Just take note of how the indentation looks.
#
# It is extremely important that your whitespace be consistent. The official PEP-8 Python Style Guide says to use 4 spaces whenever indenting and to stay away from tabs. However, as long as we are consistent with our whitespace, everything will be fine... until we try to merge our code with someone else's that uses a different indentation standard. Then we'll see this warnings like this in our terminal a lot:
#
# IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
# We advise that you have your text editor render whitespace, especially while coding in Python. This will place a pale gray dot in each space so y


Instancing a User 
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.logged = True
    def login(self):
        self.logged = True
        print(self.name + " is logged in.")
        return self
    def logout(self):
        self.logged = False
        print(self.name + " is not logged in")
        return self
    def show(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.name}. You can email me at {self.email}.")
        return self

#You can easiliy create a class in Python by typing the keyword class followed by the name of your class

class User:
    pass # pass is a placeholder 

class ClassName:
    # attributes and methods here (we'll talk more about these in a moment)

# Think of the class as a blueprint for creating something. Once we've finished our blueprint we can create instances of this class. The User class we defined above is a blueprint for creating users. We create a new instance by using the class name as if it were a function. Let's go ahead and make instances of our User class
Michael = User()
Anna = User()

Classes include two types of things:

# Attributes: Characteristics shared by all instances of the class type. Think about what we want to know about our users, for example. We may decide that all users should have a name and an email. We'll show you how to handle this in the next module.
# Methods: Actions that an object can perform. A user, for example, might be able to make a purchase. A method is like a function that belongs to a class. It's some instructions that will only work when called on an object that has been created from that class. We'll show you how shortly.



CREATING A CLASS 
# declare a class and give it name User
class User:
    # the __init__ method is called every time a new object is created
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        # set some instance variables. just like any variable we can call these anything                --- INSTANCE VARIABLES(ATTRIBUTES) ---
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.logged = False
    # this is a method we created to help a user login             --- METHOD CREATION ----
    def login(self):
        self.logged = True
        print(self.name + " is logged in.")
        return self
#now create an instance of the class
new_user = User("Anna","anna@anna.com")
print(new_user.email)
# More about self later. After the __init__() method is another method called login(). All the method does for now is print a string. The logic we need to log a user into a web app is pretty complicated. It requires a database, for one. We'll be writing the code for that later in Flask.

SELF 
# You can change the state of an object by making modifications only to self. The self parameter includes all the information about teh individual object that has called the method. Without self every time we change 
#one of the object's attributes we would change the attribute for all the items of that type. 

__init__()
# Python's init method is known as a magic method, magic methods are automatically created and sometimes invoked when a new instance class is created. 

# example
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.logged = False
    
user1 = User("Anna Propas", "anna@anna.com")
print(user1.name)
print(user1.logged)
print(user1.email)
# Above, we are able to create objects that share characteristics but are still separate and distinct. When the object is created, we can specify the values we'd like to assign to each attribute. 
# In the __init__() method we are assigning the values we passed in as values of the attributes of each individual object.

# Note: We can create two objects that are identical in regards to the data they store, but they will be different. 
# This is because each object will be stored in different places in memory and is referred to according to that unique placement.
# The above concepts can be challenging to learn and confusing at first. It'll get easier over time, but first, you have to challenge yourself to learn something tough. Stick with it!

CHAINING Methods

user1.login().show().logout()
#IS POSSIBLE if you make sure to remember to return self for each method like below. 
class User:
    def login(self):
        // your code goes here...
        return self

#Flask allows for integrating templates. You have to name templates "templates" for flask to know where to look for templates. 

from flask import Flask, render_template  # Import Flask to allow us to create our app, and import
                                          # render_template to allow us to render index.html.
app = Flask(__name__)                     # Global variable __name__ tells Flask whether or not we
                                          # are running the file directly or importing it as a module.
@app.route('/')                           # The "@" symbol designates a "decorator" which attaches the
                                          # following function to the '/' route. This means that
                                          # whenever we send a request to localhost:5000/ we will run
                                          # the following "hello_world" function.
def hello_world():
    return render_template('index.html')  # Render the template and return it!
if __name__=="__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)                   # Run the app in debug mode.



#in the templates folder create index.html and pop in a basic html skeleton 
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Template Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>My name is {{name}}</p>
  </body>
</html>

# now in the hello world function change the return statement to be this 

return render_template("index.html", name="Jay")

#When you run the app you will see that {{name}} in the HTML file was replaced by the variable that we passed to the render_template function!
#Flask uses a templating engine called Jinja2 to parse through files looking for {{}},
#replace variables with real values, and send a complete HTML file back to the client.

Example of how to embed python in flask template

from flask import Flask, render_template
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template("index.html", phrase="hello", times=5)
if __name__=="__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

#Then the templates folder should contain a index.html file that  looks like this. 
<html>
    <head>
      <title>My First Template</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h3>My flask template with embedded Python-like code</h3>
      <!-- this will output the value of our phrase variable -->
      <p>Phrase: {{ phrase }}</p>
      <!-- this will output the value of our times variable -->
      <p>Times: {{ times }}</p>
      <!-- here is an example of embedding a for-loop in our code -->
      {% for x in range(0,times): %}
      <p>{{ phrase }}</p>
      {% endfor %}
      <!-- here is an example of embedding an if statement in our code -->
      {% if phrase == "hello" %}
 Â Â Â Â  <p>The phrase says hello</p>
      {% endif %}
    </body>
</html>
# In the above code, we used the different embedding tags to output some of our variables, insert a for-loop,
# and do some conditional checking with an if statement in our HTML template. It's especially important to see how we 
# used the values that we passed into our template from our server file in the embedding tags.

# These tags allow us to control what gets rendered (if statements), 
# how many times something gets rendered (for loop) and printing values to our rendered html.

# Although you technically can do a lot of logic in your templates, 
# you should try to limit that logic as much as possible. Do the bulk of your logic in your Python code. 
# If you put too much logic in your templates, you may slow down your server response time.

# As we mentioned previously, Flask uses a templating engine called Jinja2.
#  Jinja2 has a lot of great built-in features that allow us to place dynamic information on HTML pages.
